How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    I could find the changes without looking through every line of the file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?

    It can make me more efficient at finding mistakes and find changes made by others to the file.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
    
    Pro: I have control over it
	Con: may forget

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Files can be interrelated in git projects

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    
	Can find any two commits and compare the two and look for changes  

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
    
    I can always go back to revert/undo changes or find where bugs were introduced.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
